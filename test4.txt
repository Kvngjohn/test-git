Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), have led to significant transformations across the security sector, showcasing a notable shift in the facilitation of operations like facial recognition, surveillance activities, and threat detection mechanisms. The adoption of IoT gadgets, including surveillance cameras, intelligent locks, sophisticated alarms, door/window sensors, and advanced detectors, assumes a critical role in overseeing security frameworks, thereby enabling swift responses to potential risks and ultimately bolstering the overall security protocols that are in place.
